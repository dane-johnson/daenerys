Daenerys is my attempt to create a Clojure-like lisp hosted on Python. 
The project comes from an interest in creating interpreters and dissatification with [Hy](http://docs.hylang.org/en/stable/),
a project with similar objectives.

## Features
- Call Python objects and modules with the `.` syntax.
- Call Python constructors with the `new` syntax
- Clojure-like macro system
